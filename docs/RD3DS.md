# RD3DS

Not to be confused with 3DSRemoteDesktop. RD3DS does the same thing but, err, better.

# Features  
 - Possibly better or at least more stable framerate? I think? I didn't really compare.   
 - Option menu *HOLD START AND SELECT TO OPEN*, with a couple of quality options.   
 - Err... Oh, right. Handles connections and disconnections better. Sometimes it fucks up but mostly you should be able to leave the server running and connect/disconnect multiple times, or viceversa.   
 - Server doesn't close with Esc. If you want to close it just close it. With the little red X.   
 - Client doesn't partially obscure the screen with a message.   
 - The first row of pixels is not at the end...   
 - 100% C. Not sure that's something to be proud about, but...
