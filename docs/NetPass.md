# NetPass

Introducing NetPass:

In the current state of the world, the 3DS is, sadly, on decline. That makes getting StreetPass'es harder and harder, due to fewer and fewer people taking their 3DS with them on a walk.

This is where NetPass comes in!

Unlike StreetPass, NetPass works over the internet. Upon opening NetPass, you can pick various locations to go to, i.e. the train station, or a town plaza. Upon entering a location, you get passes of others who are in the same location!

And, while you are at the location, others who enter it can get passes with you. But beware! You can only switch locations once every 10 hours!

# **FAQ English**

## **How do I use this thing?**

You open the app and then it presents you the option to enter a virtual location. Currently there are six: the train station, the plaza, the mall, the beach, the arcade and the cat cafe. Upon entering a virtual location you can get netpasses of others who are also in that location.

## **Any time I open the app it says I am in a location. What's up?**

Once entering a location, a 10-hour long session is started. During those 10 hours any subsequent opening of the app will reconnect you to the same location. After 10 hours have elapsed you can choose a new location.

## **I only got like one netpass when entering a location, wtf?**

On the first connection your data is uploaded to a database. There is a chance you receive passes immediately, however given more time your data will “pair” with someone else’s data which will then be available to download. This random pairing __***can***__ occur once an hour, so there is no guarantee you will receive passes every time the database updates. Imagine it as someone with a 3DS walking past you, this can happen 2 times a day or 40 times a day, depending on your luck. Your uploaded data will remain in this pairing state for up to 30 days, therefore checking in and switching locations is advised, especially since each location has its' own database. Patience is key.

## **Do I have to leave this app open? Can I put my 3DS to sleep?**

There is no need to leave NetPass open to accumulate passes. The pairing of datasets happens server side, you simply need to check in every so often. After you choose a location, the bottom screen will show a Checking inbox status. After it stops, you can exit the app by pressing "A". If you got any streetpasses, the green bubble should appear next to a game or title to indicate that you got data for that title

## **On the bottom screen it says error xxx, what do i do?**

There are some errors on networking currently, e.g. if you start the app before your 3DS has internet connection, so chances are it might work if you just close the app and open it again. If, however, the issue persists, please leave a post in this thread, *including* the error code.
```-6: App was started before the Device had internet access, make sure it’s connected first
-28: Connection timed out. Try a different network, yours might be unstable/too slow
-60: Certificate Error. Make sure Date and Time on your device is accurate
-502: Server side issue, nothing you can do, please post
-503: Server side issue, nothing you can do, most likely maintenance```

## **Will normal streetpass still work?**

Yes it will!
