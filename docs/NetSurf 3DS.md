# NetSurf 3DS

This is the first (to my knowledge) homebrew port of a modern-ish web browser to the 3DS! (It is also my first 3DS homebrew release, so hopefully I'm doing it right ;D)

Unlike previous attempts at a homebrew web browser, NetSurf 3DS is a port of a pre-existing browser, namely the NetSurf web browser.

NetSurf is known for being extremely portable and lightweight, even reportedly working on <32MB of RAM in some cases.

It even has a framebuffer front-end, meaning that no 3rd party GUI libraries are required.

This makes it (in my opinion) an ideal case for porting to the 3DS (yay)!

# Features
 - Browsing to webpages with SSL (HTTPS) <= 1.2 (which is better than the 3DS default browser with insecure SSL <= 1.1)
 - submitting basic HTML forms (like Google's search bar)
 - entering web addresses and values for text entries with the 3DS's system keyboard.
 - PNG, JPEG, BMP, and GIF images.
 - Basic HTML/CSS
