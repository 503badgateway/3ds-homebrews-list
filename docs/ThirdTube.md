# ThirdTube 

Inspired by NewPipe, I implemented the parser of YouTube webpages to extract the important information (metadata, stream urls, comments, etc...).

The advantage of this web-scraping is the speed; compared to the New 3DS browser, the only way to watch YouTube on the 3DS now,

this app is faster because it does not fully parse HTMLs or run javascripts.

 It does not even load css and some javascripts that are not related to the information we want to gain.

By combining this parser with the fast decoder by Core_2_Extreme, we can have a better YouTube client on the 3DS.
